This is an unorganized collection of random notes and comments as I develop this library.

1. I'm still learning the maven structure so right now the SchedulerDemo is embedded in the library which I
   would really prefer to pull out and into its own area.

2. I've decided to use Joda as a replacement for the Java Date libraries as I find the java date stuff
   unnecessarily complicated to use and I would rather spend my time understanding higher level concepts.

3. For now, almost all changes sent to the Model trigger a complete redraw of the layout.  I need to first
   get it all working before I start worrying about how I can optimize the drawing.



Known Restrictions:
-------------------
+ Appointments can not be schedule more fine than seconds.

+ Appointments can not span multiple days.


Features To Add:
----------------
+ Drag and Drop of appointments to move them around in a day, or across schedules.

+ Add week view.  This would allow dragging appointments around and resources around on given days.

+ Add month view.  This would convey information about what resources where scheduled to be available on which
  days.  For each resource it might be nice to show percentage of availability.  Like resource 1 is 50% booked
  on the 5th of November.

+ Allow per-resource scheduling in the day.  In other words, resource 1 could be available
  from 8am - 1pm and resource 2 from 12pm - 5pm.
